# CS 140: Homework - Alert with Numbers

üîéüîçüîéüîç [See the example here](https://purple-sand-0cee30710.4.azurestaticapps.net)

## Instructions
Create a webpage with a button that triggers an alert when clicked. The alert will display a number that increases with each button click. For extra credit, the alert will also print whether the number is even or odd.

### Setup
- Add a button that the user can click.
- Use a <script> tag to include your JavaScript in the same HTML file.

### Control the number variable

- Initialize a number variable that starts at 0.
- Every time the button is pressed, the number should increase by 1.

### Trigger an alert

- Use the alert() function to display the number each time the button is pressed.

### (Optional - Extra Credit):

- Check if the number is even or odd.
- Add the result (either "even" or "odd") into the alert message (hint, you can use concatenation or [template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) to do this).
